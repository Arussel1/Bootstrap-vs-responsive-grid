            <h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
            <p>In Vanilla HTML and CSS, creating a responsive design from scratch required careful consideration of media queries and grid layouts. It took more time and effort to fine-tune the design to work seamlessly on various devices.</p>
            <p>In BootStrap, using Bootstrap made responsive design quicker and easier, but it had some limitations in design flexibility. Customization beyond Bootstrap's predefined components required extra effort.</p>

            <h2>Ease and Speed of Implementation</h2>
            <p>Bootstrap was easier and quicker to implement due to its pre-defined classes and responsive grid system. It reduced the need for writing custom CSS, which sped up development.</p>
            <p>Pure HTML/CSS offered more creative freedom but required more time to design and adjust the layout for responsiveness.</p>

            <h2>Personal Preference</h2>
            <p>My personal preference depends on the project requirements. For rapid development and when working with a team, Bootstrap is convenient. However, for projects that require unique designs and complete control, I prefer pure HTML/CSS.</p>
